I've heard it said that Anaal Nathrakh declined a bit after In The Constellation of the Black Widow. This would be understandable, as said album was in my opinion one of the greatest extreme metal albums ever created. I don't think A New Kind Of Horror tops that either, but it's nice to see that the band is to some extent trying new things. If they want to top Constellation, they won't do it by retreading the same musical ground.
<br>
<br>
So, the songs themselves. When Forward was released as the first single, I (and probably many others) thought it was a bit of a departure for Anaal Nathrakh. At first, I disliked that song, but I grew to really like it after a few listens. It's one of the catchier songs in Anaal Nathrakh's discography. Still, I'm not sure how I would feel about a whole album of songs like it, and Anaal Nathrakh did not in fact release an album like that. Why they chose to release such an anomalous song as the first single I'm not sure. The rest of the songs still have that dense apocalyptic atmosphere Anaal Nathrakh is loved for, but with some differences. The Reek of Fear and New Bethlehem/Mass Death Futures, among others, feature some impressive Halford-esque falsettos, which is not something I've heard from this band before. I think those really worked well. Anaal Nathrakh have always used harsh and clean vocals to add some contrast to their music, and this adds yet another dimension to the songs. The song titles are (as usual) quite good, with names like "The Apocalypse is About You!" and "Are We Fit for Glory Yet (The War to End Nothing)" That's something I've always liked about Anaal Nathrakh, those kinds of evocative over-the-top titles. It sums up what the band's about.
<br>
<br>
Also of note is the concept of the album. I love me a good concept album, so they get points for attempting it. I'm not sure of what kind of plot is actually happening in here, as the lyrics are, as always, pretty impenetrable, but I can glean some idea from the song titles and various statements by the band members. I do know that the album revolves around World War I, which is a perfect event for Anaal Nathrakh to do an album about. And the whole album does sort of capture that mood: horrible senseless constant slaughter with an undertone of sadness and regret about how on Earth it could have come to this. There's also a bit more social commentary on here than usual, usually talking about the general stupidity and futility of war. The dispassionate spoken-word segment over Dave Hunt's tortured screaming in VI Coactus really made an emotional impact on that front. Forward also has a lot of that, with lines like "Your country needs you, so start killing" and "It'll all be over by Christmas", which help lend an air of poignancy to the general horror of what's going on here.
<br>
<br>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<
There's also the matter of how much of a difference this is from previous albums. As noted above, it might not be great if the whole album was made up of Forward-esque songs, but it also wouldn't be great if it sounded exactly like previous albums. It's a delicate line they have to walk, and i think they've erred on the side of caution. That's where most of the docked points come from here: parts of this feel like a retread of past work. In general, the songs are quite good in execution and a bit more experimental than usual, but they could have gone a bit further.
<br>
<br>
Faults aside, A New Kind of Horror is a pretty good album. A few albums in the future, once we can view this in a historical context, we might view it as a transitional album toward a new and interesting direction. I hope so, anyway. There's some cool stuff on here that's not the standard Anaal Nathrakh fare, and it'll be interesting to see the band explore that in the future. And who knows, maybe one day, if they do it right, they'll top In The Constellation Of The Black Widow. I eagerly await that day, if it comes.
